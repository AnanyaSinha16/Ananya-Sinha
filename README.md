## 🌱 A little about me  

I’m a **Java-focused backend developer in the making** who enjoys understanding how systems work behind the scenes. I like building applications that solve real problems through **clean architecture, scalable APIs, and reliable backend logic**.

I’m currently sharpening my skills in **Java, Spring Boot, Microservices, and MERN**, and I learn best by building, experimenting, and debugging. For me, debugging isn’t frustrating — it’s a puzzle I genuinely enjoy solving.
